# Smart Connections `v4`

## What's new in v4

Smart Connections v4 focuses the core plugin on a simple promise: install, enable, and AI-powered connections just work. Advanced configuration and power-user workflows now live in Pro plugins. Read [Introducing Pro Plugins](https://smartconnections.app/introducing-pro-plugins/?utm_source=connections-release-notes) to learn more.

### Pause connections

Use the new Connections "pause" button to freeze the connections results. This allows you to move through your vault while keeping the connections to a specific note visible while you work.

### Copy connections as list of links

Right-click the connections results to *copy all links* to clipboard.

### Copy all connections content (Context Engineering)

Click the connections view menu button and "Send to Smart Context" (briefcase icon) option. This allows you to quickly copy *all content from the connections* to clipboard for use as context with any AI chat! The Smart Context view also lets you add or remove items before copying all to the clipboard in one-click!

### Pinned connections

In addition to "hiding" connections, you can now "Pin" connections. This ensures the pinned connections are always visible in the connections view. **Connections Pro:** *Hidden and pinned connections are used by new connections algorithms (available in Pro) to improve results!*

### Events and notifications

Important events are now surfaced in a dedicated notifications modal:

- On desktop, click the Smart Env item in the status bar to open the notifications modal.  
- On mobile, a Smart Environment notice appears at the bottom of the Connections view; tap it to review events.

Examples of events you might see:

- Initial indexing complete for your vault  
- Sources reimported after model changes  
- Warnings when exclusions block indexing on specific folders or files  

Objectives of the new Events system:

- make the environment inspectable and understandable
- reduce the number of Obsidian native notifications

### Connections Pro

Connections Pro builds on the core plugin and Smart Environment to give power users more control.

Examples of Pro features:

- **Inline connections**  
	Small badges in the editor that show how many strong matches a block has, with a pop-over of related blocks and notes.  
- **Footer connections**  
	A persistent panel that updates as you type so high value connections stay visible while you write.  
- **Configurable scoring and ranking**  
	Choose different algorithms for how results are scored and optionally add a rerank stage.  
- **Connections in Bases**  
	Use `score_connection` and `list_connections` in Obsidian Bases to show similarity columns and related note lists in tables.  
- **Advanced filters and models**  
	Extra Smart Environment controls for embeddings, collections, and include or exclude rules.  
- **Early release experiments**  
	New ideas launch in Early channels first so supporters can shape how they evolve.

Connections Pro is part of the [Pro plugins](https://smartconnections.app/pro-plugins/?utm_source=connections-release-notes) family and is available to active project supporters. It is still built on the same open Smart Environment. Supporting Pro helps fund development of all Smart Plugins and the free core.
