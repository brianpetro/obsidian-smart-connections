1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. No licensee or downstream recipient may use the Software (including any modified or derivative versions) as a substantial component of any product or service that:
   (a) is marketed for use with, or primarily interoperates with, Obsidian or any substantially similar note-taking or knowledge-management application; and
   (b) is offered as a general-purpose solution to multiple unrelated customers (whether for a fee or free of charge); and
   (c) directly competes with any commercial offering of the Licensor based on the Software that exists at the time such product or service is first made available to third parties, meaning a typical target user would reasonably view it as a replacement or alternative because it provides substantially the same core functionality.

This restriction does not limit private use, internal use within a single organization, or bespoke or client-specific implementations (including for a fee) that are not marketed or distributed as a general-purpose product or service to multiple unrelated customers.
