### Step 4: Import Conversation History (Optional)

If you want to preserve your existing conversations:

```javascript
// In Developer Console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
// This exports your current chat history
const history = app.plugins.plugins['smart-connections'].main.smart_chat_model.conversations;
console.log(JSON.stringify(history, null, 2));
```

Save this output to a file for reference.

### Step 5: Test Migration

1. **Start a New Conversation**
   - Open Smart Chat
   - Ask a simple question about your vault
   - Verify Claude Code responds with relevant context

2. **Test Context Integration**
   - Ask about specific notes in your vault
   - Verify relevant content is automatically included
   - Check response quality and relevance

3. **Test Performance**
   - Try a complex query
   - Monitor response time
   - Ensure streaming works properly

## Settings Migration

### Configuration Mapping

| Current Setting | Claude Code Equivalent | Notes |
|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| API Key | Not needed | Local processing |
| Model Selection | claude-code-cli | Fixed model |
| Temperature | Not directly configurable | Default behavior |
| Max Tokens | Context length limit | Configurable |
| Custom Instructions | Built into prompts | Auto-generated |

### Advanced Configuration

#### Context Settings
```javascript
// In Smart Connections settings
{
  "claude_code": {
    "max_context_notes": 5,        // Replaces context window management
    "context_length_limit": 1000,  // Per-note character limit
    "semantic_threshold": 0.6      // Relevance filtering
  }
}
```

#### Performance Settings
```javascript
{
  "claude_code": {
    "timeout": 60000,              // Request timeout
    "max_retries": 3,              // Error retry attempts
    "streaming": true              // Enable streaming responses
  }
}
```

### Migrating Custom Prompts

If you had custom system prompts:

**Before (API-based):**
```javascript
{
  "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant for my research notes..."
}
```

**After (Claude Code):**
The context-aware prompts are automatically generated, but you can customize behavior through conversation style.

## Troubleshooting Migration

### Common Migration Issues

#### 1. "Claude Code CLI not found"

**Problem**: Smart Connections can't find the CLI
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check installation
which claude  # macOS/Linux
where claude  # Windows

# Fix PATH issues
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/claude"

# Reinstall if necessary
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

#### 2. Poor Performance After Migration

**Problem**: Responses are slower than API
**Solutions**:
- Reduce context size: Lower `max_context_notes`
- Upgrade hardware: More RAM/better CPU
- Optimize vault: Remove unused files
- Check system resources: Close other applications

#### 3. Context Quality Issues

**Problem**: Claude doesn't include relevant notes
**Solutions**:
```javascript
// Adjust semantic search threshold
{
  "semantic_threshold": 0.5,  // Lower = more inclusive
  "max_context_notes": 8      // Higher = more context
}
```

#### 4. Conversation History Lost

**Problem**: Previous conversations don't appear
**Solution**: This is expected. Conversation history is provider-specific and doesn't migrate automatically.

#### 5. Streaming Not Working

**Problem**: Responses appear all at once
**Solutions**:
- Check Claude Code CLI version
- Restart Obsidian
- Disable/re-enable streaming in settings

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. **Check Logs**: Enable Developer Console and look for errors
2. **Test CLI Directly**: Use `claude --help` to verify CLI works
3. **Restart Everything**: Close Obsidian, restart, try again
4. **Join Community**: Ask for help in Discord or GitHub Issues

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to your previous API configuration:

### Quick Rollback

1. **Restore Settings**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Smart Connections ‚Üí Smart Chat ‚Üí Models
   - Select your previous provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Re-enter your API key

2. **Restore Backup** (if created)
   ```bash
   # Restore settings backup
   cp ~/.obsidian/plugins/smart-connections/data.json.backup ~/.obsidian/plugins/smart-connections/data.json
   ```

3. **Restart Obsidian**
   - Close and reopen Obsidian
   - Verify your previous configuration is restored

### Complete Rollback

If you want to completely remove Claude Code CLI:

```bash
# Uninstall Claude Code CLI
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Or remove downloaded binary
rm /path/to/claude-code-cli
```
