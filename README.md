## A brief history
The journey of Smart Connections is one I directly share with you. Smart Connections isn't just about some new features in Obsidian; it's a reflection of our shared experiences, your invaluable feedback, and a testament to what we can achieve together in the Obsidian community. A journey that's been both exhilarating and profoundly educational.

Obsidian wasn't my first attempt at trying to manage and make sense of my notes. 
And in late 2022, like what has happened with all of my past attempts, the system I had built in Obsidian was beginning to fall apart. There were too many notes and I didn't have enough time to organize, link, tag, and otherwise manage them properly.
Smart Connections started as way for me to keep track of my thousands of notes, prevent rework, and make new connections by showing relevant notes/excerpts alongside whatever note I was currently working on via the Smart View.

Soon after its initial release, the community recognized the opportunity for Smart Chat, so you can now chat with your notes, using the same technology behind the Smart View.

From there, the Smart Connections community has continued playing a major part in its progress, from testing early-release versions, coming up with ideas for new features, solving issues, and enabling me with the resources necessary to spend more time building software that enables individuals with AI!

## Mission
Smart Connections is about more than technology; it's about community, collaboration, and the shared journey of enhancing our note-taking experiences. Here's a brief look at the motivation behind Smart Connections, followed by heartfelt testimonials from our users.

The Smart Connections mission is making AI technology for individuals, emphasizing accessibility, and fostering a community-driven development. Unlike many tools that prioritize corporate interests, Smart Connections is a testament to the power of open-source, user-supported software in making advanced technology accessible to everyone.

Open-source has been around for a long time. Still, over the past decade, the primary beneficiary of open source has shifted away from individuals and toward corporate interests. This shift can be seen by looking at the many VC-funded "open-source" projects.

In contrast, Smart Connections is designed for individuals, emphasizing accessibility for the less technical, and is funded directly by users.

> "I believe that open-source software that serves individuals directly, like Smart Connections, is one of the best ways we can ensure equitable access to AI-provided opportunities."

## How it Works

Smart Connections utilizes advanced AI technology to analyze and connect your notes in Obsidian. Here's an overview of how the plugin operates:

### Creating embeddings
- When you first install Smart Connections, it processes all your notes to create "embeddings" - numerical representations of your notes' content.
- These embeddings are stored in a hidden `.smart-env` folder in your vault.
- The plugin uses file modification times to determine if a note needs to be re-processed, ensuring efficiency.

## Easy Installation
Getting started with Smart Connections is easy. Simply install Smart Connections from the Obsidian Community plugins to begin enhancing your Obsidian experience with AI-powered functionalities.

### Installing from Obsidian community plugins
![](./assets/obsidian-community-smart-connections-install.png)

## Settings
### Default settings
##### Local embedding models
Local embedding models enable leveraging the power of Smart Connections without sending data to any third-party for processing. 

`BGE-micro-v2` is a small and reliable local embedding model used by default.
This allows Smart Connections to work out of the box‚Äîno API key, additional software, or setup required!

### Additional setup
#### File/folder exclusions
You can exclude specific files or folders from being processed by Smart Connections. This is useful for ignoring irrelevant or sensitive information.

#### Changing AI models
Smart Connections supports various AI models for both embeddings and chat. You can change these in the plugin settings to suit your needs and preferences.

##### OpenAI API Key
- Requires pre-paying for API credits if you choose to use OpenAI's models

## Features

### Smart View
The Smart View provides real-time note suggestions based on your current note.

![Demo showing Smart View results changing based on the current note](./assets/SCv2-Smart-View-dark.gif)

##### Accessing notes in the Smart View
- Click to open a result in the Smart View 
- Preview connections using the expand/collapse (fold/unfold) button to the left of each result
- Expand/collapse all feature (displayed below)

![Demo showing the fold/unfold feature which displays or hides the content of the notes in the Smart View](./assets/SCv2-fold-unfold.gif)

##### Smart View Search
Click the search icon to input a search query.
- Note: it's important to remember that embedding search (semantic) does not function like a traditional keyword search (lexical).
### Smart Chat
Notes are retrieved to and used as context in the conversation when you input a self-referential pronoun like "my" in "Based on my notes..." 

##### ChatMD (new in `v2.1`)
Chat history is saved as a new note for each conversation.
###### `sc-context` codeblock
- prevents duplication of notes used as context in the chat history
- renders a Smart View containing the notes or excerpts used as context

Creating content that shows how you're using Smart Connections not only helps development, but also helps existing and potential users better understand how they can benefit from utilizing AI, creating an impact that extends beyond this project! 
##### Screencasts
Your contributions through video testimonials on how you use Smart Connections are invaluable. These insights not only help improve the plugin but also assist in showcasing real-world applications to the community.

Screen recording tools like Loom make it easy to record and share screencasts. If you create on of these screencasts, please share it with the community. I try to re-share this type of content on all of my available channels as much as possible. 

## Content & Resources
- Videos added to README
- SC Backlinks (third-party content)

## Smart Connections Architecture
Delve into the architecture behind Smart Connections, designed with efficiency and user benefit in mind. Key design principles include:
- minimizing external dependencies for easy to audit code
- working out of the box to maximize ease of use
- modular open-source components for re-use in other project
### Local Models
- Local models are an important development because they enable utilizing AI without sending potentially sensitive data to third-party providers like OpenAI.
- Smart Connections `v2.0` introduced built-in local embedding models. Built-in models are easy-to-use and do not require installing or configuring third-party software. The default embedding model for new users is a local model.
- Smart Connections `v2.1` introduced advanced chat model configurations so that the Smart Chat to can utilize local chat models running locally.
### Dependencies
*Minimizing dependencies has been a key principle in the development of Smart Connections.* 
##### First-party Dependencies
These are modules that I developed with the same principle of minimizing dependencies.
- [`smart-environment`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-environment)
- [`smart-collections`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-collections)
- [`smart-entities`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-entities)
- [`smart-sources`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-sources)
- [`smart-blocks`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-blocks)
- [`smart-chat-model`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-chat-model)
- [`smart-embed-model`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-embed-model)
##### Third-party Dependencies
- `transformer.js`: a library for running AI models by Hugging Face
	- This is *not* bundled by default and is only used if you are using local models.
	- This dependency is loaded within an iframe which "sandboxes" the code.
### Themes & Styles
Styles are designed to inherit from the user's theme whenever possible.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Embedding process keeps restarting or is slow
- This is not normal behavior. First, try switching to the reliable BGE-micro embedding model in the settings. 
- If issues persist, check the developer console for any error messages and share screenshots of the errors to get further assistance.

### OpenAI API errors
- Make sure you have pre-paid API credits in your OpenAI account. OpenAI recently changed their billing system to require pre-paid credits.
- Double check that the API key you entered in the Smart Connections settings matches the account you added credit to. There are separate API key settings for embeddings and chat.
- Share screenshots of the specific API errors from the developer console to get more targeted troubleshooting help.

For quickest support, always include screenshots, especially of any errors in the developer console (View -> Toggle Developer Tools). Searching existing issues on GitHub is also recommended for Obsidian plugin problems.

## Features
### Smart Chat: Transform Your Notes into Interactive Conversations
Enhance your note-taking experience with [Smart Chat](https://wfhbrian.com/introducing-smart-chat-transform-your-obsidian-notes-into-interactive-ai-powered-conversations/), a plugin that turns your notes into an AI-powered interactive chat. Retrieve information, clarify concepts, and explore ideas by engaging in a conversation with your notes.

![](./assets/smart-connections-chat-who-am-i.gif)

#### How Smart Chat Works
- To access Smart Chat, open the command palette and select "Smart Connections: Open Smart Chat." If you already have the Smart View pane open, you can also access the Smart Chat by clicking the message icon in the top right.
- In the Smart Chat pane, type your question or message and hit Send or use the shortcut `Shift+Enter`.
- The AI will analyze your notes and provide a relevant response based on the content in your vault.
	- **Note**: Currently, to trigger a search of your notes, you must use a self-referential pronoun (ex. I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, ours).
- You can continue the conversation by replying to the response or asking follow-up questions.

#### How does Smart Chat retrieve information on my notes?

The Smart Connections plug-in uses a retrieval strategy known as HyDE. Put simply, Smart Connections takes your prompt and uses embeddings to decide the top 20-30 notes in your vault that would provide an accurate response to the question. It then feeds these chosen notes to the OpenAI GPT model as a large, amalgamated prompt and returns an answer based on that information.

If you ask questions on a topic which can be found across more than those 20 or 30 notes, the response may be less comprehensive. It is better to be as specific as possible with your questions, so that the HyDE process can feed only the most relevant notes to the GPT AI.

#### Chat Features
- **Context-aware responses**: Smart Chat understands the context of your notes, providing responses that are accurate and relevant to your specific content.
- **Natural language processing**: The AI-powered feature interprets and responds to your questions in a conversational manner, simulating a chat with a real person.
- **Multilingual support**: Smart Chat can understand and respond to queries in multiple languages, allowing you to interact with your notes in your preferred language.
 
![](./assets/smart-connections-chat-backstory.gif)

##### Coming soon!
- **Note linking**: If a response references a specific note in your vault, Smart Chat will provide a link to that note for quick access.
- **Current-note chat**: Have a conversation based on a specific note instead of the entire vault.

#### Benefits of Smart Chat
- **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Quickly access specific information in your notes without having to search and browse through numerous files.
- **Improved Knowledge Retention**: Engaging with your notes through a conversational interface helps reinforce your understanding and recall of the material.
- **Creative Exploration**: Discover new connections and insights as you interact with your notes, fostering an environment for brainstorming and idea generation.

#### Limitations
- The quality of the responses depends on the content and organization of your notes. Ensure your notes are well-structured and comprehensive for the best experience.
- Smart Chat may occasionally provide incorrect or irrelevant responses due to the limitations of AI understanding. In such cases, rephrase your question or provide more context for better results.

### Smart View

![Smart View demo showing that the most relevant notes are shown at the top based on the current note.](./assets/SCv2-Smart-View-light.gif)

- Notes with multiple matching blocks can be expanded to show the matching blocks.
- Search feature that uses embeddings to search for notes in your vault.
- You can click on a note to open it in the current pane or hold down the `ctrl` or `cmd` to open it in a new pane.
- To preview the notes in the Smart Connections Pane, you can hold down the `ctrl` or `cmd` key to preview the note while hovering over it.
- You can drag and drop a link from the to become a link in your note or open it as a new tab.

### Smart View: Dynamic Code Block
The dynamic code block feature allows you to create a dedicated section within your notes for Smart Connections. By labeling this code block as `smart-connections`, the content within the block will be specifically used to find relevant connections in your vault.

#### How to Use the Dynamic Code Block
To create a dynamic code block for Smart Connections, follow these steps:
1.  In your Obsidian note, start a new code block by typing three backticks followed by `smart-connections`.
2.  Press Enter to create a new line, and type the content you want to use for finding Smart Connections. This can include keywords, phrases, or even full sentences that are relevant to the note and its context.
    - If left blank, the plugin will use the entire content of the note. This returns the same results as the default Smart Connections pane (Smart View).
3.  Close the code block by typing three backticks on a new line after your content.
![](./assets/sc-dynamic-codeblock-code.png)
![](./assets/sc-dynamic-codeblock-rendered.png)
### Section 'block' matching
- Smart Connections plugin will use 'blocks' of text in your notes to find the most relevant connections.
- Currently, a 'block' is a section of text that is separated by a heading.
    - For example, if you have a note that contains the following text: `# Header 1\nThis is a block of text.\n# Header 2\nThis is another block of text`, then the plugin will search for similar blocks of text in addition to making smart connections with similar files.

### Highlight to find Smart Connections
- Highlighted text will be used to find Smart Connections when you run the "Find Smart Connections" command

![](./assets/search-feature.png)

## How it works
- The Smart Connections Pane is opened when you activate the plugin. You can also open it from the command palette with the "Open: View Smart Connections" command.
- Each time you open a note, the plugin will search for similar notes in your vault and display them in the Smart Connections Pane (sidebar). The Smart Connections Pane will display the most similar notes first using the cosine similarity of the note's embeddings.
- The plugin will only search for similar notes in the current vault. It will not search for similar notes in other vaults.

### Initial processing
- The plugin will process all your notes and store the embeddings in a hidden folder in your vault called `.smart-connections` in a file called `embeddings.json`. This file is used to cache the embeddings of your notes so that they do not need to be recalculated each time you open a note. `file.mtime` is used to determine if a note has been modified since the last time Smart Connections calculated the embeddings. The `embeddings.json` file can get to be quite large, so it is recommended that you exclude the folder from your sync settings.
- The initial processing may take a while, depending on the number of notes in your vault.
- The plugin will only process notes that are in the current vault. It will not process notes in other vaults.
- The cost of the initial processing is proportional to the number of notes in your vault. Without any exclusions configured in the settings, the amount of tokens used in the initial processing is approximately 2X the total number of "tokens" in your entire vault. A rough calculation for this is `the total number of characters in the vault` divided by `2`. For example, if your vault contains 100,000 characters, then the initial processing will cost approximately 50,000 tokens. The current token cost is $0.0004 per 1,000 tokens (as of [2021-08-01](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)) which is estimated to be ~$1 USD for 3,000 pages (assuming 800 tokens per page).

## Settings
- `File Exclusions` - Enter a comma-separated list of file or folder names to exclude from the search completely. For example, if you want to exclude all files that contain the word "drawings" in the file name, you can enter "drawings" in the field. If you want to exclude all files that contain the word "drawings" or "prompts" in the file name, you can enter "drawings,prompts" in the field.
- `Folder Exclusions` - similar to `File Exclusions` but only matches folders instead of anything in the file path.
- `Heading Exclusions` - Enter a comma-separated list of headings to exclude. Smart Connections will exclude 'Blocks' with headings that match the Heading Exclusions from the search. 
	- For example, use this if you have a commonly occurring "Archive" section in many files and do not want the contents to be included when making smart connections.  
	- This only applies to 'blocks' and does not change the content used for matching entire files.
- `Show Full Path` - Show the full path of the file in the Smart Connections Pane. If turned off, only the file name will be shown.

### Settings (Advanced)
- `Force Refresh` - this will force the plugin to recalculate the embeddings for all files in your vault. This plugin is designed so that you SHOULD NOT need to use this feature.
## Error handling
- If you encounter an error, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues).
## Developing Add-ons
- **Coming soon**: Use Smart Connections in your plugin! Prevent the headaches of managing vector storage and save your users money by reusing their existing embeddings.
	- **Note**: This feature is currently in beta. Create a GitHub issue if you want to learn how to use the beta version of this feature.
- This plugin is designed to manage the vector interpretation ("embeddings") of the notes in your vaults. The requirements for managing this can be extensive.
- While there are many ways to interpret the vector relationships and make them useful this plugin is focused on delivering the core capabilities required to utilize such a system.
