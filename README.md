> I just stumbled across a forgotten 20-page Google Doc I poured my heart into months ago, and the rush of lost momentum hit me like a punch.  
> — Brian (December 2022)

> [!QUESTION] **Is this you?**
> You're an Obsidian power‑user, researcher, writer, or lifelong learner with **hundreds or thousands of notes**. You capture ideas quickly, but later struggle to find and connect them when it matters most.

> [!WARNING] **The Problem**
> Valuable insights disappear in a sea of unlinked notes, forcing endless scrolling, re‑reading, and duplicated work. Time you wanted for creativity leaks away into manual organization.

> [!SUCCESS] **What Success Looks Like**
> With Smart Connections running, ideas resurface precisely when you need them, writing flows faster, and your note‑taking system finally feels like the trusted "second brain" you imagined.

## Mission-driven
The Obsidian community opened my eyes to user-aligned software. That's why Smart Connections is [built on principles](https://smartconnections.app/smart-principles/) in an effort to create the most user-aligned Smart Tools available.

> [!INFO] **Your Guide**
> Built by Brian, a fellow Obsidian user who felt the same pain, Smart Connections pairs hard‑won experience with open‑source AI expertise to lead you from overwhelm to insight.

## Private by Design, Privacy by Default
User-aligned means privacy, local-first decisions, are by design and implemented by default. Privacy shouldn't be an opt-in only or premium feature. Smart Connections default settings are designed to work with zero setup, using a local AI embedding model that works offline.


> [!NOTE] Welcome to our Smart Community 😊
> Hey there! I'm 🌴 Brian. I built Smart Connections to help solve my organization problems. My hope is that it can save you from the same chaos!
> - How does it feel when you realize you forgot something that was important to you? Why capture more notes if the ideas get lost in oblivion?
> - What if you didn't spend so much time organizing? What could you have done with all that lost time spent organizing?
> 
> These are the questions I'm trying to answer. Smart Connections is one piece, albeit a corner piece, representing an important first step in exploration of how AI can empower individuals like you and I.
> 
> *Smart Connections isn't a silver-bullet*. But, it is the a key Smart Tool that can **empower us to do more!**
> 


Smart Connections isn't an alternative. It's a catalyst for you and I to realize our most extraordinary visions for the future.

## Built for You

> [!NOTE] Smart Connections changed my life
> Smart Connections started as a personal tool, like many others I built before it. But, this time was different.
> 
> This time, the Obsidian community became a part of the process. From the beginning, Smart Connections users empowered me to realize the potential of user-aligned tools for thought. 
> 
> The earliest adopters, like Sarah, gave me critical feedback that improved the software and provided financial support that enabled me to focus on the project full-time. 
> 
> Matthew joined the community and started our Community Lean Coffee meetings, which have become an invaluable resource and introduced me to many more people that have given their time and resources to support my work.
> 
> This experience made me realize how we can work together to empower each other with new ideas and user-aligned tools to thrive with AI.
> 
> Smart Connections helped me realize my core-value & purpose of empowerment. It empowered me to make the connection of synergy between my love for building and empowering ordinary people to achieve extraordinary results.

### It's not about features, it's about empowerment
I build tools that empower you (me) to bring your (my) ideas to reality. 

### Built from scratch
Building the Smart Environment, the core architecture behind Smart Connections, from scratch has empowered me with a deep understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI. These insights are why I believe the Smart Ecosystem will outlast me.

### Stronger together
Smart Connections represents a threat to profit-driven enterprises that benefit from powerless individuals. User-aligned software means leveraging efficiencies that are out-of-reach for major corporations. I hope my journey inspires you to break-free from the belief that you are limited and that others are in control.

### Come for the tools, stay for the community
Smart Connections users come for the tools, but they stay for the mission-driven community and our shared vision of empowering ourselves with Smart Tools and Workflows. Together, we are on a journey of exploration and empowerment!

## Smart Ecosystem
As luck has it, I began jotting down lines of code for automations in my school notebooks. This grew into a skill for designing complex systems.

### Smart Plugins
I build Smart Plugins, like Smart Connections, to empower myself to explore new concepts, design better tools, and handle more complexity in my Obsidian. My goal is to make as many of these concepts and tools available to you.
[Browse all Smart Plugins](https://smartconnections.app/smart-plugins/) →

### Smart Business Model
The reality is that most valuable tools cannot exist without financial support. But that doesn't mean having to sell-out or shutdown. Obsidian has shown us that valuable software can be user-funded, and I believe now is a better time than ever to bring the vision of user-aligned software to reality.
#### Principle: Build local tools to maximize empowerment
Software that runs locally can empower unlimited users with zero-marginal cost. 
#### Principle: User-supported means user-aligned
Early & experimental features are provided to supporters. This means more-reliable software with a valuable feedback loop from users invested in making the project better.

## FAQs & Troubleshooting
### Syncthing (third-party syncing)
*Official services, like Obsidian Sync, help keep Obsidian user-aligned. Smart Connections has built-in compatibility with Obsidian Sync.*
However, if you must use a third-party sync service, be sure to **add the `.smart-env/` directory to "ignore patterns"** to prevent issues.

### Windows dedicated GPU
If embeddings default to the integrated GPU, set `ollama.exe` to **High performance** in your GPU control panel.
See [issue #1028](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues/1028#issuecomment-3070187288) for context.
