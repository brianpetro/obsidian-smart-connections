```

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Enable Smart Connections
After installation, Smart Connections immediately begins creating local embeddings for semantic search - no API key required!

### 2. Start Chatting with Your Notes
Open Smart Chat from the ribbon or command palette. With Claude Code CLI enabled, your conversations automatically include relevant context from your vault.

### 3. Find Related Content
The Connections view shows semantically similar notes to your current file, helping you discover forgotten connections and insights.

### 4. Privacy-First Configuration
All processing happens locally by default. Your notes never leave your computer unless you explicitly configure external APIs.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üîç Smart Connections (Semantic Search)
- **Zero-setup local embeddings** using Transformers.js
- **Real-time updates** as you write
- **Block-level connections** for granular insights
- **Exclusion patterns** for private content

### üí¨ Smart Chat with Claude Code CLI
- **100% local processing** with Claude's capabilities
- **Automatic context inclusion** from relevant notes
- **File/folder references** for targeted conversations
- **PDF support** - drag research papers directly into chat

### üéØ Additional Capabilities
- **Multiple language support** via local models

## üôè Attribution & Acknowledgments

### Original Creator
This project is based on the excellent [Smart Connections plugin](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections) created by **Brian Petro**. Brian's vision of user-aligned, privacy-first tools has been foundational to this work.

### Smart Environment Architecture
The core SmartEnv architecture and Smart Collections system were designed and built by Brian Petro. This implementation extends and enhances these foundations while maintaining compatibility with the original design principles.

### Community Contributions
Special thanks to the Smart Connections community for their invaluable feedback, testing, and contributions that have shaped both the original plugin and this enhanced implementation.

### Mission & Values
This implementation continues Brian's mission of creating user-aligned tools that empower individuals while respecting privacy. As Brian says: "Smart Connections isn't an alternative. It's a catalyst for you and I to realize our most extraordinary visions for the future."

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

### Your Data Stays Local
- **Embeddings**: Generated and stored locally in `.smart-env/`
- **Chat Processing**: Claude Code CLI runs entirely on your machine
- **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking or analytics
- **Open Source**: Full code transparency for security auditing

### Configuration for Maximum Privacy
1. Use Claude Code CLI (default) for chat
2. Keep local embedding model (default)
3. Exclude sensitive folders in settings
4. Store `.smart-env/` locally (not in cloud sync)

## üß™ Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Obsidian (for testing)
- Claude Code CLI (for full functionality)
