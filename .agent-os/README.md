## Usage Guide

### Starting a New Feature

#### 1. Claude Code Integration
```bash
# Copy template for Claude Code feature
cp .agent-os/templates/claude-code-integration-spec.md specs/claude-bridge-implementation.md

# Edit with specific requirements
# Follow implementation plan
# Test thoroughly for offline operation
```

#### 2. Personal Workflow Enhancement  
```bash
# Copy template for workflow feature
cp .agent-os/templates/personal-workflow-spec.md specs/meeting-notes-workflow.md

# Analyze current manual process
# Design AI-enhanced version
# Implement with Claude Code integration
```

### Development Process

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Use templates to spec out features
2. **Check Decisions**: Ensure alignment with documented architecture choices
3. **Implement**: Follow existing code patterns and conventions
4. **Test**: Verify offline operation and performance
5. **Document**: Update product docs with new capabilities

### Key Principles

- **Local-First**: All AI processing via Claude Code
- **Privacy-Focused**: No external data transmission
- **Personal-Optimized**: Built specifically for your workflows
- **Maintainable**: Clear architecture and documentation

## Current Status
