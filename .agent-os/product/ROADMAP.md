## Development Principles

### Technical Guidelines
- **Local-First**: All processing happens on your machine
- **Privacy Focused**: No external data transmission
- **Performance Optimized**: Single-user efficiency over scalability
- **Maintainable**: Clean architecture for long-term evolution

### Feature Priorities
1. **Core Intelligence**: Claude Code integration is foundational
2. **Workflow Support**: Personal productivity comes second
3. **Advanced Features**: Enhancement only after core stability
4. **Experimentation**: Room for creative exploration

### Success Metrics
- **Daily Usage**: Natural integration into knowledge work
- **Cognitive Load**: Reduced mental overhead for information management
- **Discovery**: Increased serendipitous connections between ideas
- **Confidence**: Trust in the system as external brain
