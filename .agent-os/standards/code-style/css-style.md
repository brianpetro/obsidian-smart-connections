# CSS Style Guide

We always use the latest version of TailwindCSS for all CSS.

### Multi-line CSS classes in markup

- We use a unique multi-line formatting style when writing Tailwind CSS classes in HTML markup and ERB tags, where the classes for each responsive size are written on their own dedicated line.
- The top-most line should be the smallest size (no responsive prefix). Each line below it should be the next responsive size up.
- Each line of CSS classes should be aligned vertically.
- focus and hover classes should be on their own additional dedicated lines.
- We implement one additional responsive breakpoint size called 'xs' which represents 400px.
- If there are any custom CSS classes being used, those should be included at the start of the first line.

**Example of multi-line Tailwind CSS classes:**

<div class="custom-cta bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded cursor-pointer w-full
            hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800
            xs:p-6
            sm:p-8 sm:font-medium
            md:p-10 md:text-lg
            lg:p-12 lg:text-xl lg:font-semibold lg:2-3/5
            xl:p-14 xl:text-2xl
            2xl:p-16 2xl:text-3xl 2xl:font-bold 2xl:w-3/4">
  I'm a call-to-action!
</div>
