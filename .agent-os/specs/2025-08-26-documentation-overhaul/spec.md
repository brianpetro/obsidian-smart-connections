# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Documentation Overhaul for Personal Smart Connections Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: âœ… COMPLETE
> Completed: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Transform the repository documentation to clearly position this as a personal implementation of Smart Connections with enhanced Claude Code CLI integration, complete with local build, installation, and usage instructions. The documentation should serve both end users seeking a privacy-first Obsidian plugin and developers wanting to understand or contribute to this implementation.

This spec addresses the need for comprehensive documentation that:
- Clearly positions this as a personal fork/implementation while maintaining proper attribution
- Provides complete build and installation instructions
- Documents the enhanced Claude Code CLI integration features
- Guides users through the privacy-first local processing capabilities
- Supports the JSBrains ecosystem development workflow

## User Stories

### As an End User (Obsidian Plugin User):
- I want clear installation instructions so I can install this plugin manually in my vault
- I want to understand how this differs from the original Smart Connections plugin
- I want to know how to configure and use the Claude Code CLI integration
- I want to understand the privacy benefits of local processing
- I want troubleshooting guides when things don't work as expected

### As a Developer (Contributor/Fork):
- I want complete build instructions so I can compile the plugin from source
- I want to understand the JSBrains ecosystem setup requirements
- I want clear development workflow documentation
- I want to understand the architecture and key differences from upstream
- I want testing instructions for the Claude Code integration

### As a Privacy-Conscious User:
- I want to understand how local processing works
- I want to know what data stays on my machine vs. what might be sent externally
- I want to configure the plugin for maximum privacy
- I want to understand the Claude Code CLI benefits over API-based solutions

### As a Technical User:
- I want detailed configuration options documentation
- I want performance optimization guidance
