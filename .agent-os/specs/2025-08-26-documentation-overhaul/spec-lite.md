# Documentation Overhaul - Lite Summary

Transform repository documentation to clearly position this as a personal Smart Connections implementation with enhanced Claude Code CLI integration, providing complete local build/installation instructions and privacy-first usage guidance. The overhaul will create comprehensive user and developer documentation that differentiates this implementation while maintaining proper attribution to the original project.

## Key Points
- Rewrite README.md and create docs/ directory with installation, development, and user guides
- Document Claude Code CLI integration for privacy-first local AI processing
- Provide complete build instructions for the JSBrains ecosystem development setup
