# Claude Code Integration Specification Template

## Feature Overview
**Replace [FEATURE_NAME] with specific integration component**

### Summary
Brief description of what this Claude Code integration accomplishes.

### User Story  
As a user of my personal second brain, I want [GOAL] so that [BENEFIT].

## Technical Specification

### Current State
- Describe existing functionality that will be replaced/enhanced
- Note any dependencies on external APIs
- Document current data flow

### Proposed Solution
- How Claude Code will be integrated
- Communication method with Claude Code CLI
- Data flow and context management
- Error handling approach

### Interface Design
```javascript
// Example API interface
class ClaudeCodeBridge {
  async sendMessage(context, message) {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  async getResponse() {
    // Implementation  
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
