# Personal Workflow Feature Specification Template

## Workflow Overview
**Replace [WORKFLOW_NAME] with specific personal workflow (e.g., Meeting Notes, Task Management)**

### Purpose
Describe how this workflow enhances your personal knowledge management and productivity.

### Current Manual Process
- Step 1 of current manual workflow
- Step 2 of current manual workflow  
- Pain points and inefficiencies

### Proposed AI-Enhanced Process
- Step 1 with AI assistance
- Step 2 with AI assistance
- Expected time savings and quality improvements

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Primary feature requirement
- [ ] Secondary feature requirement
- [ ] Integration with existing vault structure

### AI Intelligence Features
- [ ] Claude Code analysis capability
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions
- [ ] Automatic extraction/processing

### User Interface
- [ ] Commands or ribbon actions
- [ ] Settings/configuration options
- [ ] Visual feedback and notifications

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Example data model for this workflow
const workflowItem = {
  id: "unique-id",
  type: "workflow-type",
  created: timestamp,
  metadata: {
    // Workflow-specific fields
  },
  content: "processed content",
  claudeAnalysis: {
    // AI-generated insights
  }
};
```

### Integration Points
- **Obsidian API**: How it uses Obsidian features
- **Claude Code**: What context/prompts are sent
- **Smart Environment**: How it integrates with existing systems
- **File System**: Where data is stored and organized

### User Experience Flow
1. User triggers workflow (how?)
2. System gathers context (what data?)
3. Claude Code processes (what analysis?)
4. Results presented (how displayed?)
5. User acts on results (what actions?)

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Gains
- Time saved per workflow execution
- Reduced manual steps
- Improved consistency

### Quality Improvements  
- Better organization
- Enhanced insights
- Reduced cognitive load

### Usage Adoption
- Frequency of use
- User satisfaction
- Integration into daily routine

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality
- [ ] Core workflow implementation
- [ ] Basic Claude Code integration
